# Computer system
- Divided into four components:
	1. Hardware
	2. OS
	3. Application programs
	4. Users
		1. People, machines, other computers
- OS is  a resource allocator and control program making efficient use of HW and managing execution of user programs
- Users of dedicate systems such as workstations have dedicated resources but frequently use shared resources from servers
- Mobile devices like smartphones and tables are resource poor, optimized for usability and battery life
	- Mobile user interfaces such as touch screens, voice recognition
- Some computers have little or no user interface, such as embedded computer
- One program that is always running is the kernel, part of the OS
- Everything eles is either:
	- A System program (ships with the OS, but not part of the kernel)
	- Or an application program, all programs not associated with the operating system
- OSes include middleware, which are a set of software frameworks that provide additional services
