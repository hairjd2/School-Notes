# Static Timing Analysis (STA)
- Tool by Vivado to make sure that your design meets timing constraints
- ![[Pasted image 20240320101303.png]]
- Static timing path:
	- Starts at a clocked element
	- Propagates through combinatorial elements and their nets
	- Ends at a clocked element
- `report_timing_summary`
- Setup area: displays all max delay analysis like setup, recovery, and data checks
	- Worst negative slack (WNS): Worst slack of all the timing paths for max delay analysis - can be positive or negative
	- Total Negative Slack: Sum of all WNS violations
	- 0 means that all timing constraints meet max delay analysis
	- Negative = violations
	- Check number of failing endpoints
	- If large number of failed endpoints, check overall design like the reset or cross domain issues
- Hold area:
	- Can usually ignore hold issues since implementation will fix it
- Pulse Width Area: Displays all checks related to pin switching limits, including min low pulse width, min high pulse width, min period, max period, max skew
	- Worst Pulse Width Slack (WPWS): Worst slack of all the timing checks when using both min and max delays
	- Can have issues if duty cycle is too small
- Can check duty cycles in clock summary section
- Other Path Groups:
	- Usually shows "\*\*async default\*\*"
- Check User Ignored Paths for false paths
- Unconstrained paths have non-analyzed paths
- Launch edge: clock edge that sends the data out from a seq element
- Capture edge: clock edge that receives the data from a seq element
- ![[Pasted image 20240320104055.png]]
- Its assumed that flip flops are both rising edge flip flops
- Timing checks include clock propagation from the attached point
	- To the startpoint of the static timing path
	- To the endpoint of the static timing path
- Negative delay is normal
## Input Output Timing Overview
- Vivado knows all timing issues within the fpga as long as the constraints are set correctly
- You don't need constraints for asynchronous elements
# Applying Baseline Timing Constraints
- **Baselining**: iterative approach of adding timing constraints to your design
- Method of iterating through synthesis and implementation
1. Primary focus is to identify internal device timing challenges
2. I/O constraints can be added and verified
3. Path-specific constraints are added
- Timing Constraints Wizard
	- Tool to aid in writing and validating constraints
	- Simplifies constraint creation and validation
	- Analyzes netlist, clock net connectivity, and existing timing constraints
- Language Templates
	- Has XDC constraint templates
	- Available for most situations
- Ensure properly defined clock
- If you have two clocks with the same phase relationship, you need to configure it
- Can create virtual clock with no pins connected to it
- ![[Pasted image 20240320112841.png]]
- Can use this to prepare for any delay of I/O
- ![[Pasted image 20240320113211.png]]
- **System Syncrhonous I/O Interface**: System-synchronous I/O interfaces use a common system clock at both the source and destination
- **Direct Capture**: Capture clock can be directly used to capture the data - in such cases, flexibility to align the clock is limited
- **Capture Clock through MMCM**

- ![[Pasted image 20240320115251.png]]
- Can set clock group constraints to mutually exclude each group so that they are not consider during timing analysis
- An async clock group is when two clocks cannot be traced to a common source

# How to Apply Timing Exception Constraints
## Timing Exceptions
- Situations exist where the normal setup and hold checks are not correct for a portion of a design
- Some aspects of the architecture require modifications of these checks
- These are accomplished with exceptions
- Types:
	- False paths
	- Clock groups
	- Multicycle paths
	- Min and max delays
- ![[Pasted image 20240320130644.png]]
- Multicycle path: occur when registers are not updated on consecutive clock cycles
