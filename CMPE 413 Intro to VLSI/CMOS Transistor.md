- So far, we treated MOSFETs as ideal switches
- On transistor passes finite amount of current
	- Depends on terminal voltages
	- Need to derive I-V characteristics
- **gate** **source** and **drain** have capacitance
	- ![[Pasted image 20230920132723.png]]
- Positive/negative voltage applied to the gate (with respect to substrate) enhances the number of electrons/holes in the channel and increases conductivity between source and drain
- $V_t$ defines the voltage at which a MOS transistor begins to conduct
- For voltages less than $V_t$, the channel is cut off

- Although threshold voltage is given, its not just a magic number
# Modes of Operation
- Depends on terminal voltages
	- $V_{gs} = V_g - V_s$
	- $V_{gd} = V_g - V_d$
	- $V_ds = V_d - V_s = V_{gs} - V_{gd}$
- **Rule of thumb**: source is always lower voltage for NMOS
- Opposite for PMOS
## Three modes (very important)
- Cutoff
	- When $V_g < V_t$ or $V_{gs}$
	- $I_{ds} = 0$
- Linear or Triode
	- Channel is formed and extends from the source to the drain
	- Current flow from drain to source (electrons)
	- $I_{ds}$ increases with $V_{ds}$
	- Similar to linear resistor

	- 
- Saturation
	- Channel is pinched off near the drain
	- $I_{ds}$ independent of $V_{ds}$. $I_{ds}$ is a function of $V_{gs}$ only
	- We refer to it as current saturates
	- Similar to a current source

# MOS I-V Characteristics
- Parameters that affect the magnitude of $I_{ds}$
	- Distance between s and d
	- Channel width
	- Threshold voltage
	- Thickness of the gate oxide layer
	- Dielectric constant
	- The carrier mobility
- Summary of normal conduction characteristics
	- Cut-off: accumulation, current between drain and source is essentially 0
	- Non-saturated: weak inversion, current dependent on both $V_{gs}$ and $V_{ds}$
	- Saturated: strong inversion: $I_{ds}$ is ideally independent of $V_{ds}$
