- DC Response: $V_{out}$ vs. $V_{in}$ for a gate

- Bottom curve very important for exam
# Beta-Ratios
- $\beta=\mu C_{ox}(\frac{W}{L})$
- Get ratio that gives you rise and fall time of each transistor to be the same
- If $\beta_p \neq \beta_n$, switching point will move from $V_{DD}/2$
- Called **skewed** gate
