- If your load is too big for your gate, you need to add stages to the gate to progressively increase the size that can withstand the load instead of just increasing the size of the gate.
# Delay in Logic Gate
- Express delays in process-independent unit 
- $d= \frac{d_{abs}}{\tau}$
- Delay has two components: $d=f+p$
- f: effort delay = gh
- g: logical effort (g = 1 for inverter)
- h: electrical effort = $\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}}$
- p: parasitic delay; stays the same
