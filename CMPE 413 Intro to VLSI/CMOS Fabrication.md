# Fab Steps
1. Start with blank wafer
- Build inverter from bottom up
- First need to form n-well
	- Cover wafer with protective layer of SiO2 (oxide)
	- Remove layer where n-well should be built
2. **Oxidation**: grow SiO2 on top of Si wafer
3. **Photoresist**: spin on photoresist
4. **Lithography**: Expose photoresist through n-well mask; strip off exposed photoresist
5. **Etch**: Etch oxide with hydrofluoric acid (HF)
