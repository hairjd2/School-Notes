# History
- First IC made by Jack Kilby at TI in 1958, made of a flip-flop of two transistors
- Intel i7 has 2.3 billion transistors
- 64GB flash memory > 16 billion transistors
## Growth Rate
- Driven by miniaturization of transistors
- The nm refers to length of transistors, distance of each node
- >10^19 transistors manufactured in 2008
# Transistor
- Used to be vacuum tubes
- John Bardeen and Walter Brattain built first point contact transistor in 1947
- Power is proportional to heat
- Working with N-type and P-type MOSFET
- 1970's only had NMOS
- Only in the 1980's-present use CMOS for low idle power
- Meant to drastically reduce battery drainage
- Integration Levels
	- SSI: 10 gates
	- MSI: 1k gates
	- LSI: 10k gates
	- VLSI: > 10k gates
- Clock frequency has somewhat grown exponentially, but has flatten nowadays
- Min feature size shrinking 30% every 2-3 years

- Metal gate has been replaced by polysilicon or poly in modern tech

- Fundamental to know RC circuit
- Everything will be on that
- Digital design hates capacitance since it is proportional to power consumption

- For a buffer, should use two inverters

- Bad idea bc PMOS cannot transfer a good 0, leaving some threshold amount of charge
- NMOS can transfer a good 0, PMOS can transfer a good 1

- Having all 0's for NAND or all 1's for NOR will receive the result the fastest

- Have both pmos and nmos so that you don't have a weak signal issue
- ![[Pasted image 20230911135737.png]]
- Cross coupled inverter for storage cell
- ![[Pasted image 20230911141008.png]]
- Each inverter strengthens the signal of the other to prevent leakage
- OAI: Or And Inverter
