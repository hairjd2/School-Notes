- Metallurgical junction: large density gradient in both electron and hole concentration occurs across this junction.
- Diffusion of electrons from n-region into p-region
- Diffusion of holes from p-region into n-region

# pn-Junction in Equilibrium (zero bias a.k.a. no added current)
- These diffusions of majority carriers uncover negatively charged acceptor ions in the p-region and positively charged donor ions in the n-region.

- Diffusion of majority electrons and holes creates a space-charge region. (also called depletion region, no mobile electrons and holes, 0.1-1 micrometers)
- Setup an internal electric field (built-in potential barrier $V_{bi}$)
	- Against further diffusion of majority carriers
	- Small $I_{diff}$ (sensitive to $V_{bi}$)
- Minority carriers migrate to edges of space-charge region and be swept (drifted) through.
	- Small $I_{drift}$ (depends weakly on temp)
