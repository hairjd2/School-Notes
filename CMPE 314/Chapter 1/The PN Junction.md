- Metallurgical junction: large density gradient in both electron and hole concentration occurs across this junction.
- Diffusion of electrons from n-region into p-region
- Diffusion of holes from p-region into n-region

# pn-Junction in Equilibrium (zero bias a.k.a. no added current)
- These diffusions of majority carriers uncover negatively charged acceptor ions in the p-region and positively charged donor ions in the n-region.

- Diffusion of majority electrons and holes creates a space-charge region. (also called depletion region, no mobile electrons and holes, 0.1-1 micrometers)
- Setup an internal electric field (built-in potential barrier $V_{bi}$)
	- Against further diffusion of majority carriers
	- Small $I_{diff}$ (sensitive to $V_{bi}$)
- Minority carriers migrate to edges of space-charge region and be swept (drifted) through.
	- Small $I_{drift}$ (depends weakly on temp)

- Drawn in notes for ==02/07/23==
- The applied electric field E<sub>A</sub> is along the space-charge field E<sub>field</sub>
	- depletion region widgth increases, potential barrier is higher
	- I<sub>diff</sub> $\big\downarrow$ very small (and $I_{drift}~=I_{drift,0}$)

## Forward Bias
- ![[Pasted image 20230207145300.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230207145307.png]]
- The applied electric field $E_A$ cancels the internal space-charge filed $E_{field}$.
	- Depletion region width decreases, potential barrier is lower
	- Diffusion of majority carriers easier
	- $I_{diff} \big\downarrow$ very large (and $i_{drift} \approx i_{diff,0}$)
	- $i_D \equiv I_{diff} - I_{drift,0} > 0$
