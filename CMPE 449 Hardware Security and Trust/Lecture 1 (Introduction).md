- Shift in how hardware is created, has become more horizontal, meaning more trust is needed
- It used to be vertical where one company would do everything
- Three main segments of hardware design
	- IP Vendor
	- System Integrator
	- Manufacturer
- Three types of IP
	- Soft: when the vhdl code is sold
	- Firm: when code with generic purpose (open-source) is sold
	- Hard: when the manufactured board is sold
- Different parts on one chip could be designed by different companies, meaning that all parts must be able to trust each other

-   IC counterfeiting is the most prevalent attack today and encompasses the unauthorized production of wafers
- Estimated to cost semiconductor industry more than several billion dollars per year
- Done through:
	- Overproduction
	- Defective parts
	- Off-spec parts
	- Cloned ICs
	- Recycled ICs
- Four legally defined forms of IP
	- Patents
	- Trademarks
	- Copyrights
	- Trade secrets
- Hardware security is important
	- Manufactured ICs are obscure
	- HW is the platform running SW, storage and data
	- Tampering can be conducted at many levels
	- Easy to modify because its physical nature
- Computer security aspects
	- Confidentiality: the related assets are only accessed by authorized parties
	- Integrity: the asset is only modified by authorized parties
	- Availability: the asset is accessible to authorized parties at appropriate times
- Hardware vulnerabilities
	- Physical attacks
	- Trojan horses
	- IP Piracy
	- IC Piracy and Counterfeiting
	- Backdoors
	- Tampering
	- Reverse Engineering
