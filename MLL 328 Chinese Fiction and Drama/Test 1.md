# Dunhuang Bian-Wen
## Background
- Dunhuang is located in northwest China on the edge of the Gobi Desert along the Silk Route from Chang-an (Xi'an), the capital of the Tang Dynasty across Central Asia to Western nations.
- 500 caves were built between the 4th-14th centuries just south of Tunhuang containing Buddhist statues, wall paintings, etc.
- In 1900, Daoist priest Wang Yuan-lu discovered a hidden room off of one of the caves containing 20,000 scrolls and paintings dating from 406-996 AD. These include Buddhist, Daoist, Christian and Moslem texts, paintings on silk government records, wills, deeds, letters and documents in Chinese, Tibetan, Turkish and several other languages.
- In 1907, Sir Aurel Stein, a Hungarian acting on behalf of the British Museum induced the Daoist priest Wang into selling him a large number of manuscripts and paintings. He did not know Chinese. Now in British Museum
- In 1908, Paul Pelliot, who did know Chinese, went Dunhuang and chose many of the best scrolls. Now located in Bibloteque Nationale. Other scrolls taken to Beijing, Tokyo, St. Petersburg
## Transformation Tales
- Among the scrolls were Buddhist and lay stories called bian-wen
- Three reasons for writing texts:
	1. Practice calligraphy
	2. Earn merit by copying Buddhist texts (i.e. sutras)
	3. As prompt books to be used for oral presentations
- Written in prosimetric form
- Buddhist tales were delivered by traveling monks. Historical stories by lay storytellers
## Maudgalyayana Rescues His Mother from Hell (443-455)
- Most popular bian-wen (9 scrolls). Classic story of filial piety. Story based on over 10 sutra texts
- Storyteller focuses on vivid characterizations (Mu-lian, father, mother) and descriptions
- Many facts remain implausible. If Mu-lian has supernatural powers, why does he not see his mother earlier and why does he not heed news of his mother being in Avici Hell. Adds suspense and emotional/psychological level
- Generally, development is from oral tradition -> written text. In bian-wen, written text -> oral presentation. Oral presentations require repetition.
- Adaption to Chinese audience: focus on filial piety, combined efforts of monks and believers will liberate 7 generations of ancestors from torments of hell, one is fortunate to be born in China
- Verse sections in prosimetric style:
	- Repeat prose
	- Give detailed descriptions
	- Add new information ("Now take a look at ")
- Satire and criticism
	- People stuck in the Nether world due to mistake of names (bureaucratic blunders)
	- "Once the Son of Heaven is angered, He is capable of strewing the ground with countless corpses, So that the blood flows for a thousand miles."
