- ==PMF: Use stem(x,y) to plot the PMF (matlab)==
# Review of last class
- Bayes' Theorem: $Pr[A_1|A_2]=\frac{Pr[A_1A_2]}{Pr[A_2]}=\frac{probability both occur}{prob the "given" event occurs} \geq Pr[A_1]$
# Random Variables
- The number, $X(\omega)$, depends on the experiment outcome, $\omega$
- We'll call $X(\omega)$ a random variable
- Probability measure is a mapping
- The sample space consists of the simple events that are mutually inclusive and completely exhaustive (i.e. a partition)
- The probability measure P assigns a single real number in $[0, 1]$ to each of the simple events
- ... so we call it a mapping $S \rightarrow R$
