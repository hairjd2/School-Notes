# Intro to Chinese Drama
## Background
- The theatrical activities of the Chinese people go back to the beginning of history
	- Medium seances, dancing at temple rites, palace entertainment, clowns, jesters, musical performances
	- 2nd B.C.: acrobats brought from Central Asia, boxing, wrestling, fencing, tumbling, ropewalking, sword swallowing, etc. Also: puppet shows
	- 6th-7th A.D. plays ("The Big Face" with Prince Lan Ling leading troops; "The Swinging Wife" complaining of husbands beatings). Combination of singing, dancing, dialogue.
	- Tang dynasty: "Military Counselor" (comedy, farce, political satire) thousands were trained in Chang-an to sing, dance and act in the palace
	- Song dynasty: Variety plays (za ju): singing, dancing, acrobatics, theatrical show. Composed of prelude, 1-2 scenes, musical epilogues. Song "tile districts" in Kaifeng and Hangzhou were entertainment parks with professional storytellers and acting guilds of 5-7 members. Performed in cicties and countryside on set stages and at festivals.
## Yuan Drama
- Mongols indirectly responsible for growth of drama. Kublai Khan deeply distrusted Confucian scholars and he abolished the civil service examination. This big blow to the aspirations of four generations of scholars gave rise to popular literature. Originally a pursuit of Book Guilds and actors, now scholars has to make a living. The Mongol rulers also liked drama, music, and singing and supported theaters in Beijing and Hangzhou. Natural development from Tang and Song drama.
- New variety plays
	- Had 4 acts or song sequences
	- Hade wedge in form of prologue or interlude
	- All songs in act sung by male or female protagonist
	- North China style
	- Poetry/songs most important (dialogue and plot conventional, not much characterization)
	- Categories (Love and intrigue; religious and supernatural; historical and pseudo-historical; murder and lawsuit; bandit-hero)
- Southern Drama (flute in south, lute in north): 40 or more scenes, Ming dynasty
- Beijing Opera: arose around 1790
	- Four main role categories:
		1. Sheng - Male role
		2. Dan - Female role
		3. Jing - Painted face male
		4. Chou - The comedy
	- Every motion and pose carefully manipulated, beauty in every movement, sparse stage, combines music, vocal performance, mime, dance and acrobatics
	- Different aesthetic, very stylized, symbolic, not meant to be realistic but rather suggestive.

	- Duan Xiaolou ![[Pasted image 20231218212716.png]]
## Social and Political Background
- The time covered is 1924 through 1977. The setting is Beijing; it spans 53 years, presenting two main characters' lives against the historical backdrop of China in upheaval.
- "Farewell My Concubine" interweaves the story of Cheng Dieyi and Duan Xiaolou with:
	- The rule of the Beiyang Government ruled by the nationalists (beginning in 1924)
	- The Japanese invasion of China and the surrender of the Japanese at the end of World War II (1937-1945)
	- Continued rules of the Nationalist Government (1945-1949)
	- Victory of the Communists in 1949, the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and the aftermath (1978)
## The cultural revolution period in Chen Kaige's film
- The movie's director, Chen Kaige, knows about the Cultural Revolution first hand.
- Born in 1952, he was sent in 1969 to a rural area to do manual laber; the scenes involving the Peking Opera's youth training programs may owe something to this experience
- Chen Kaige was the son of a filmmaker. He was a Red Guard and a soldier before enrolling in film school, and at one point actually denounced his own father, an act for which he still feels great shame. (The father, sentenced to hard labor for several years, worked with his son as artistic director of this film.) He also witnessed how his own mother was brutalized by the Red Guards and how the cultural revolution destroyed not only people labeled as "anti-revolutionaries, intellectuals, capitalist roaders," but also literature, arts culture, and tradition.
### The Gold Fish Symbol:
- Like a gold fish, his life is on stage for others to enjoy and watch.
- Like a gold fish, he is trapped in his own world.
- Like a gold fish in a glass fish aquarium, its world can be shattered easily like the aquarium made of glass.
### The Shoe Symbol:
- Shoe "鞋" is pronounced the same as the word "邪", which means "evil."
- Juxian is willing to give up everything including her shoes for Xiaolou, implying she is giving her past dishonorable life as a prostitute and starts her new life with Xiaolou.
- The shoes reappeared right after the scene of Juxian's suicide as a final indictment against the destructive consequences of the cultural revolution - how it had stripped people of their basic decency and humanity. Being blinded by extreme political ideology, one can be driven against one's own brother, parents, spouse, friends, and neighbors.
## Questions for Discussion

- Struggle between public and private lives
- Major themes:
	- betrayal vs. loyalty "Being faithful onto death"
	- Obsession
	- Contrast of living in a dream vs. living in the real world (Idealism vs. Realism)
	- Gender identity or homosexual/gay
	- Was Cheng Dieyi gay?
