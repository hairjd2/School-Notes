# Chapter 8: Application: The Costs of Taxation
## Deadweight Loss of Taxes
- Both buyers and sellers are worse off with taxes
	- Raises price buyers pay
	- Lowers price the seller recieves
- Consumer and Producer Surplus is reduced
- Reminder: Outcome is the same whether a tax is levied on buyers or sellers

## Tax Impact on Market Participants
- Use consumer and producer surplus to determine
	- Consumer surplus - benefit to buyers
	- Producer surplys - benefit to sellers
	- Tax revenue = benefit to government
		- Size of Tax (T) multiplied by the Quantity of the good sold (Q)
		- Rectangle between supply and demand curves on figure 2

## Deadweight Loss and Tax Revenue as Taxes Vary
- As a tax rises, the deadweight loss increases
	- Deadweight loss rises more rapidly than the size of the tax
- But overall: total revenue will decrease as the rate increases over time
	- Initially, a gain
	- Over the long run, the high tax reduces the size of the market

## The Laffer Curve and Supply-side Economics
- 1974, ECONOMIST Arthur Laffer
	- Laffer curve
	- supply-side economics
	- Tax rates were so high, Laffer argued that reducing them would actually raise tax revenue
- Ronald Reagan's Argument
	- Taxes were so high that they were discouraging hard work
	- Lower taxes would give people the proper incentive to work
- Economists debate validity of Laffer's concept
	- No consensus on relevant size of elasticities
	- Would have to revisit 80's and not have tax cut to see if he was correct
	- Could be true in Sweden, which has traditionally high tax rates
