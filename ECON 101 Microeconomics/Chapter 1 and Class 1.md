# Chapter 1
- Economics: study of how society manages its scarce resources
- Microeconomics: how households and firms make decisions and how they interact in markets
- Revolves on 10 essential ideas:
	1. People face trade-offs
		1. There's no such thing as a free lunch
	2. The cost of something is what you give up to get it (opportunity cost)
		- Opportunity cost: Whatever must be given up to obtain some item
		- Example: Cost of going to College
		- Lamar, LeBron, and Cuoho (Weezer)
	3. Rational people think at the margin
		- Rational people systematically and purposefully do the best they can to achieve their objectives
		- Example: preparing for class, or eating Oreos and bing watching TV
		- Marginal change: a small incremental adjustment to a plan of action
	4. People respond to incentives
		- Gasoline tax
		- Increase in price of apples
		- sale on cookies
		- unintended consequences can occur: seatbelts in cars and accidents
	5. Trade can make everyone better off
		- Trade allows each person to specialize in the activities he or she does best
		- Farmer vs accountant
	6. Markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity
		- Market economy: an economy that allocates resources through the decentralized decisions of many firms and households as they interact in markets for goods and services
		- Communism vs. market economies
			- Communism: central planner (government) allocates scarce resources
			- Market economy: scarce resources allocated by decisions of millions of firms and households
		- "Invisible hand" - Adam Smith
	7. Governments can sometimes improve market outcomes
		- Market economies need institutions for several reasons
			- To enforce property rights- ability of individual to own and exercise control over scarce resources
			- To promote efficiency and equality
		- All of these factors will help avoid market failure
	8. A country's standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services
	9. Prices rise when the government prints too much money
		- Inflation
	10. Society faces a short-run trade-off between inflation and unemployment
		- Short-run effects of increasing money supply:
			- overall level of spending and demands for goods and services increases
- Focus mainly 1-7
