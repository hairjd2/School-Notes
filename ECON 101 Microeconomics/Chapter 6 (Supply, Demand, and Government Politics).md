# Chapter 6: Supply, Demand, and Government Politics

## Government Intervention
### Price Ceilings
- Price ceiling: a legal maximum on the max on the price at which a good can be sold
- If ceiling is set above market equilibrium, then the price is not a binding constraint
	- Move to equilibrium
- If ceiling is set below market equilibrium, then the price is a binding constraint

#### Rent Control
- Govt places ceiling on rents that landlords can charge
	- Goal: help regulate rents for the poor - create affordability
- Adverse effects:
	- Short-run: inelastic supply and demand (landlords can't adjust housing units, and renters take time to adjust housing arrangements)
		- Shortage
	- Long-run: Elastic supply and demand (landlords build less housing units and don't maintain current apartments, low rents increase the number of people looking to move out of their parent's house to find a place)
		- Large shortage

### Price Floors
- Price floor: a legal min on the price at which a good can be sold
- If floor is set below equilibrium price = not binding
- If floor is set above equilibrium price = binding
	- Result: surplus in quantity supplied
- Example: minimum wage
#### Minimum Wage
- Lowest price for labor that any employer may pay
- Encourages people to enter the labor market for a job
- Creates a surplus labor supply = unemployment
- Greatest impact = teenage labor (& unskilled labor)
### Evaluating Price Controls
- Generally economists oppose price floors/ceilings
	- Markets better under equilibrium
- However, sometimes price controls are needed to improve market outcomes
	- Efficiency vs equity
	- Caveat: these policies may hurt those that they are trying to help
### Taxes
- Taxes are used to raise revenues for public projects
- Tax incidence - the manner is which a burden of a tax is shared among participants in a market
#### Elasticity and Tax Incidence
- How to figure out who takes on more of the tax burden (look at elasticities of supply and demand curves)
- Elastic supply/inelastic demand - tax falls more heavily on consumers
- Vice versa for producers
