# Chapter 3 Interdependence and the Gains from Trade
## Key principle
- **Trade can make everyone better off**
- If both are ONLY good at their craft, specialize in trade
- BUT, what if one person is better at producing BOTH goods!
## Absolute vs Comparative Advantage
- Absolute advantage - the ability to produce a good using fewer inputs than another producer
	- In our previous case, the rancher has the absolute advantage in both products due to time
- Comparative Advantage - the ability to produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another producer
