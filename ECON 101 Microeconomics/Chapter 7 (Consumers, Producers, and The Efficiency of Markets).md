## Market Efficiency
- Benevolent Social Pllaner
	- Maximize social well-being in society
	- To do this, looks at total surplus
- Total Surplus = Value to buyers - Cost to sellers
	- AKA: Sum of producer and consumer surplus
- Efficiency is a property of resource allocation
	- Results in a maximizing the total surplus received by all members of society
	- Is the "pie" as big as possible
- Equality is the property of distributing economic prosperity uniformly among the members of society
	- How the "Pie" is sliced and distributed to society
