# Chapter 2 (Thinking Like an Economist)
## Is like a science
- Scientific method: understand why economic events occur
## Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF)
- Output that the economy can possibly produce given the available factors of production and the available production technology
- Point C on slide 6 is impossible (unless you can improve the technology)
## Opportunity Cost
- The cost of something is what you give up to get it
- Opportunity cost is not constant
	- Cost is highest where the economy is producing many cars and few computers (slide 6)
	- Curves can change over time
## Micro vs Macro
- Micro: study of how households and firms make decisions and how they interact in markets
- Macro: economy-wide phenomena, including inflation, unemployment, and economic growth
- Economists are asked to explain the causes of events
- Economists are asked to recommend policies to improve economic outcomes
## Positive versus Normative
- Positive statements - claims that attempt to describe the world as it is
	- "Lower income taxes increase overall consumer spending"
- Normative Statements ("should" and "ought to") - claims that attempt to prescribe how the world should be
	- "The government should lower income taxes."
