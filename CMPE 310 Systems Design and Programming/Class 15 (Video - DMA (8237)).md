## Disk Memory Systems
- Magnetic and optical:
	- Floppy disks
	- Hard disks
	- CD-ROMs and WORMs
	- DVD
- ### Floppy
	- The recording format called MFM (Modified Frequency Modulation) used to write double density format
	- Heads actually contact the surface, leading to wear out
- ### Optical Disks
	- Pits burned onto disks, if light is reflected it means a 1, otherwise a 0
- ### Hard Disks
	- Has multiple disks
	- Need to know the parts of the hard disk for final and possibly next quiz
	- Hard Disks use MFM or RLL (Run-Length Limited) to store information
		- RLL 2,7 is common today -- this indicates that the number of zeros in a row is always between 2 and 7
	- The data is encoded with this table:

- ### SSD Solid State Drive
	- Uses flash memory instead of disks
	- More shock resistant
	- Doesn't have the same capacity
## Video Displays
- Composites are disappearing since high-resolution cannot be achieved
- Most modern systems use direct video signals with separate sync signals
- The TTL RGB Monitor:
	- It uses TTL level signs (0 or 5V) as video inputs and a 4th line called intensity.
	- It can display a total of 16 different colors (CGA) in older systems

	- The connector pin definitions for either color or monochrome
