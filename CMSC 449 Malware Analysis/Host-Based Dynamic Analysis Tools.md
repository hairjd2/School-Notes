- Goal of basic dynamic analysis is to investigate how malware interacts with the infected computer when run
- Good idea to take a snapshot before dynamic analysis so that you can come back to it
- Turn off network
	- Details -> settings -> NAT -> Attached to: not attached
- Prof usually runs malware admin all of the time
- cmd.exe will be parent process if malware is run in command line
# Process Explorer
- High-powered task manager tool, from windows internal
- Great for inspecting processes that malware interacts with
- Called "procexp"
# RegShot
- Take a snapshot of the registry AND filesystem
- Then run malware and take a second snapshot
- Compare differences to see what changes made by malware
# Process Monitor (ProcMon)
- Inspect ops made by running proc
- Creates huge amount of output, need to filter
- Can run out of memory so don't run for long
- Allows for detailed log of events of what happened to your computer
- Can investigate most Windows API calls and their arguments
- Make sure magnifying glass is crossed out when done running (dumb not ik)
