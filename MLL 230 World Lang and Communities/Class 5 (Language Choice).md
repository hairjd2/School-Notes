# Class 5: Language Choice: The Social Motivations for Language Use in Interpersonal Interactions
## Language Choice
- In all multilingual communities speakers switch among languages or varieties as monolinguals switch among styles.
- Laguage choice is not ==arbitrary== and not all speech communities are organized in the same way.
	- Index of interpersonal relationship
	- Symbolic motivations for choice (diglossia)
	- Acts of identity
## The Cooperative Principle
- Grice (1975) suggested that conversation is based on a shared principle of cooperation
- This principle was fleshed out in a series of maxims.
## The Relative Principle
- An essential feature of most human communication, both verbal and non-verbal, is the expression and recognition of intentions.
- The degree of revelance is a cost benefit analysis between the reward of understanding the stimulus and theprocessing reuquired to make senseof the stimulus.
- The choice of variety to use is following those principles!!
## Extended Diglossia
- Domains and situations often determine choice, "wrong" choice results in rejection:
	- Using second language among all native (but bilingual) speakers
	- Using L in H domain
	- Choice is not always a conscious one
- Economic, administrative, cultural, political, religious (among other) pressures influence language choice
	- Competing pressures can result in unclear domains and result in unexpected choice
## Social Distance
- Honorifics and referential deference
	- Indexes the status of the referent (absolute hierarchy or depending on who the referent is)
		- Ex: Terms of address or reference: Dr., Sir, Excellency
- Interactional deference
	- Indexes the relative status of the interlocutors
	- Use of pronomial systems (Tu vs. Vous)
	- In all cases:
	- **Power and Solidarity, social proximity or distance**
## Speech Accommodation Theory
- Accommodating to your interlocutor
	- speaking more like the person you're talking to
- Accommodating away from your interlocutor (=divergence)
	- Intentionally distinguishing yourself from who you're talking to by changing your way of speaking
- Audience design model
	- There are many participants who may affect the speaker
## Markedness Model
- **Choose the form of your conversational contribution such  that it indexes the set of rights and obligations which you  wish to be in force between the speaker and addressee for  the current exchange.**
- Unmarked
- Marked
## Why codeswitching
- Switching as identity marker
- Pragmatic switching
- Dicursive (meaning-making) function of switching
- Switch for variety of reasons
	- Not always clear which code to be used
## Language Choice or Language Constraints
- Specifically:
	- Personal relationships
	- Respective social status of the languages
	- Social and Professional obligations: in what social groups are bilingual individuals found?
		- Linguistic Minorities? Not always
		- Migrants
	- Pragmatism and every day practice
	- Political Posturing
	- Expressively and affect
- **This endless interplay between constraint and choice means that identities are necessarily dynamic, emergent, and contextual rather than static, predetermined, and immutable**
# Language Choice in Multilingual Cameroon
## Cameroon
- Country in the west Central African region
- Bordered by: 
	- Nigeria to the west
	- Chad to the Northeast
	- Central African Republic to the east
	- and Equatorial Guinea, the Republic of Gabon and the Republic of Congo to the South
### Pre-colonial
- Strong emotional relationship between language and ethnicity
- Language expresses solidarity
- Language use often corresponds with tribal affiliation
- State of autonomy vis-a-vis each other
- Language can set people apart from other and bring them together
### History of Cameroon
- 1472- Portuguese sailors reached  Cameroon’s coast. They noticed  the abundance of shrimps in the  River Wouri, so they named the  Region River of Shrimps, (Rio dos  Camarones, in Portuguese).
- 1520 - Portuguese set up sugar  plantations and slave trade in  Cameroon.
- 1600s - Dutch take over slave  trade from Portuguese.
- 1884 - Cameroon becomes the  German protectorate of  Kamerun.
- 1911 - Under the Treaty of Fez -  signed to settle the Franco-  German conflict over Morocco,  France cedes territories to the  east and south to Cameroon  (known as "Neukamerun").
- 1916 - British and French troops  force Germans to leave Cameroon.  Neukamerun is separated from  Cameroon again.
- 1919 - London Declaration divides  Cameroon into French (80%) and  British administrative zones  (20%). The British zone is divided  into Northern and Southern  Cameroons.
- 1960 - French Cameroon  granted independence and  becomes the Republic of  Cameroon.
- 1961 - Following a UN-sponsored  referendum, the (British) Southern  Cameroon gains independence by  joining the Republic of Cameroon  and the territory becomes the  Federal Republic of Cameroon, British Northern Cameroon gains  independence by joining the  Federal republic of Nigeria.
### During Colonial Rule
- Refusal of colonists to learn the native languages led to imposition of European languages as official languages
- Imposition of European languages - instrumental to ensure political cohesion (nation-building)
- Competence in colonial languages = passport to better life
- Colonial languages = medium of education
- African languages = seen as inferior, inadequate
### Postcolonial context
- ukolonia: “many people in postcolonial contexts display this  “ukolonia” tendency because they tend to undervalue  many things that have their contextual reality in favour  of Western constructs. Some people in such contexts  now perceive their own culture and indigenous  languages as inferior. They think that the colonial  languages are the only media through which effective  communication can take place and are even ready to  negotiate their own identities to embrace one that  strongly links them to the Western world.” (p. 151)
### Languages
- Official: French and English (growing)
- Daily life: 
	- Kamtok (Cameroonian Pidgin English)
	- Camfranglais (Francanglais)
	- Mbotok
- Other languages
	- 281 - Cameroon is ranked as the third most linguistically diverse country in the world (after Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu)
## Pidgin vs Creole
- Pidgins are a grammatically simplified form of a language, used for communication between people not sharing a common language.
- Pidgins have a limited vocabulary, some elements of which are taken from local languages, and are not native languages, but arise out of language contact between speakers of other languages.
- Creoles a mother tongue formed from the contact of two languages through an earlier pidgin stage
- *confusing because quote “Pidgins” are often Creoles.
## English and Kamtok
- English language:
	The boy who came yesterday was annoyed that he was not accepted. After  a quarrel with me, he went off sorry for himself. We were later told that he  told our boss that he was rejected because I hated him. The boss later  called me to his office and questioned me about the reasons I refused to  take in the boy in question and I told him. Tanga (the boy) was noted as a  notorious thief and he is a mischief in the community.
- Kamtok:
	The boy whe cam yesterday be vex say them no gri yi. After whe yi quarrel  with me, e comot go, sorry sorry. After them be tell we say e go tell wah  boss say we no take yi because i hate yi. Wa boss bin call me for yi office,  and question me for know the reason why i no take the boy. I tell yi the truth.  That boy Tanga na tif man and no some very bad boy for quarter.
# Discussion Questions
1. Do you think there is a difference between code-switching in different languages and code-switching in different dialects? Can you name specific instances?
2. Who experiences stigma from code-switching? Can you think of anyone who experiences societal benefit from code-switching?
3. When does code-switching go unnoticed, and why?
