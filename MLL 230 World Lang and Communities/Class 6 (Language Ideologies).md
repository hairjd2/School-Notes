# Class 6 Language Ideologies
- They represent the ideas, beliefs and feelings  of people about the varieties and languages  involved: that one linguistic form or code  sounds more beautiful or more ugly, is  superior or inferior, is more or less formal - in  short, is on some dimension better or worse  than another. (p. 255)
## Iconization
- Iconization is the way a group uses their  language as an identifying factor of their  group.
- The "southern drawl" becomes an icon  for being a Southerner in the US.
(=Shibboleth)
## Recursion
- “Involves the projection of an  opposition, salient at some level of  relationship, onto some other level”
(Irvine and Gal 2000: 38).
- It's taking the iconized language and  'othering' anyone with different language  identifiers
- Think of the way Southerners from various  states identify others by their drawls: the  Texan might 'other' the Tennessean because  they have a different drawl. Now, imagine the  Texan thinks the Tennessean isn't truly a  Southerner because his language is different.
## Erasure
- “is the process in which ideology  renders some persons or activities  (or sociolinguistic phenomena)  invisible” (Irvine and Gal 2000: 38).
- The original fact will be obliterated.
- simplifying the linguistic field, leaves certain people, histories, or activities invisible
## Colonial Language Ideologies
- Dogma of homogeneity: a view of society in  which differences are seen as dangerous and  centrifugal and in which the “best” society is  suggested to be the one without intergroup  differences.
- Multilingual societies are still perceived as  essentially monolingual (Germany, France,  Netherlands, Great Britain)
## Language with Attitude
- Strong connection between language  attitudes and other social/cultural beliefs and  practices
- Language attitude studies can assess  attitudes toward the language itself
- However, these attitudes often reflect  attitudes toward the speakers of those  languages/varieties.
- Ultimately attitudes to language reflect  attitudes to the users and the uses of  language…
- There is nothing intrinsically beautiful or  correct about any particular sound.
- People develop attitudes towards languages  which reflect their views about those who  speak the languages, and the contexts and  functions with which they are associated.
## Methodology
1. Social Treatment
	- Observing use in public domain
	- Examining government documents about status
	- Educational document
	- Employment advertisements
	- Dialect representation in novels
	- Cartoons (societal stereotypes)
	- Newspapers, books
2. Direct measures
	- Ask direct questions about attitudes
	- Written questionnaires (possible large scope)
	- Well-known problems with questionnaires
3. Indirect measures
	- Matched guise technique (less in your face) A test to distinguish between speakers using different accents
	- First used by Lambert (1960):
		- French/English bilinguals read a spoken text in French and English;
		- Then French and English speakers had to evaluate the personality of the speakers in  dimensions such as good/bad, friendly/unfriendly, educated/uneducated, etc.;
		- The Judges did not know that they were evaluating the same speaker twice (in “matched  guises“).
	- As a result, the reaction to the same person  differed depending on:
		- the language used;  
		- the linguistic affiliation of the person making the judgement.
	- Experiments like this found that:
		- the differential power of particular social groups is reflected in language variation and  attitudes towards this variability;
## Discriminating language
- Choice of certain dialects, languages,  registers connotes an understanding of  social/power relations in a particular  context.
	- No one form is inherently superior or inferior
	- Prestige
- ### Standardization and "correctness"
	- Belief that language standards are natural
	- Language standardization treated more as ideological process than as empirical linguistic  facts.
	- “a bias toward an abstracted, idealized,  homogeneous spoken language which is imposed from above, and which takes as its  model the written language” (Milroy & Milroy, 1985)
	- Association of the standard with the qualities  valued within the culture (such as clarity or  truthfulness).
- In diglossic communities H variety seen  as purer or better than L
	- Often supersedes questions of solidarity  with L variety
- Teachers
	- Views regarding non-standardness related  to ethnicity of teachers and students.
	- Non-white students rated as ethnic and  non-standard regardless of actual  language use.
# Ideologies and Attitudes in Norway: The Sámi people
## A single people in four countries
- The Sámi people live in four countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia.
- The total population in these four countries is estimated at  approx. 80,000, of whom around half live in Norway. 
- Slightly under half of these people speak Sámi.
### Where do the Sámi live?
- In Norway, the Sámi  people live in almost  all parts of Northern  Norway, and in  Trøndelag and in  Hedmark.
### Bures boahtin! (The language)
- The Sámi people speak a language that is a member of the  Uralic linguistic group along with languages such as Finnish,  Estonian and Hungarian.
- Norwegian and other Indo-European languages are not  related to the Sámi language.
- A total of nine different but closely related Sámi varieties  are spoken in the Sámi region.
- Sámi people from the south of Northern Norway can talk  effortlessly to their nearest Sámi neighbours in Sweden,  but cannot communicate with Sámi people from the far  north.
- The dialect boundaries do not follow the borders,  however, as most of the dialects are spoken in multiple  countries.
### Historical Background 
- The state of Norway is founded on the territory of two people: the Sámi and the Norwegian.
- Norway is a rather young nation, and gained its  independence in 1905.
- Until then, the region had been in a continuous union  with Denmark, and then with Sweden.
## Building a Norwegian Nation
- A by-product of this building of a nation was  the oppression of the indigenous Sámi culture  and language.
- For more than 150 years, the official  Norwegian policy favoured ethnic  Norwegian culture and language, and  oppressed the Sámi culture, in order to build  an independent, Norwegian nation.

### The politics of Norweigianization
- In 1851 the government decided to gradually change  the language of teaching from Sámi to Norwegian.
- The teacher's college quit offering education in Sámi  language
### The boarding school era
- Around 1900 the government decided to build boarding schools around Finnmark
- 21 governmental boarding schools and 28 municipal boarding schools in Finnmark in 1940
- In Norwegian language and a Norwegian cultural environment
- Main purpose of the teaching:  Linguistic and cultural assimilation
- The most important subject in school: Norwegian
- Sámi language prohibited or auxiliary language in  special circumstances
- Boarding school: Norwegian language environment,  interrupted contact to Sámi culture
- Ideological influence: Sámi people lost the faith in their own language and culture
### Results of the Norwegianizing
- Sámi speakers more than 40-50  years old are not able to write  in their mother tongue
- Almost all Sámi parents in  South- and Lule Sámi areas, in  Troms and coastal-Finnmark  spoke Norwegian to their  children
- Now about 75% of the Sámi  are not able to speak Sámi
- About 50% of those who speak  Sámi speak another language  better
- Many do not want to be Sámi anymore
### Resistance
- Most people in the Norwegian society supported the  politics of norwegianizing, but there were a few  exceptions
- Among the protesters were:
	- A few priests, Norwegian teachers
	- A few Norwegian politicians   
	- Sámi teachers
	- Sámi parents
	- Sámi newspapers and organizations
### Political Status
- The Sámi Parliament is the Sámi people’s representative body in  Norway and has appreciable authority on issues concerning culture,  cultural heritage, reindeer farming and education.
- The language is official in Norway, but is not accorded the same  prominence as Norwegian.
- Previously, the Sámi people owned land and water communally, but  the Norwegian state considered this state-owned land.
- Today, however, the Norwegian authorities consider the land and  water in Finnmark to belong to the people of Finnmark. Similar  transfers of ownership have been proposed for large areas in the  rest of Northern Norway. (Finnmark Act, 2005)
### The Sámi People in Tromsø
- According to the Sámi electoral roll there are about 100,000 Sámi people.  However, these numbers are unclear because a lot of people live up to the  criteria of being a part of the Sámi population, but are not registered.
- The Sámi people do not distinguish themselves, they live like ordinary people.  Yet, they still wear their traditional costume in special occasions and they  make Sámi art and music to keep their culture alive.
- The outcome of this debate was that Tromsø did not become a bilingual city.

# Discussion Questions
1. Are language ideologies always negative? In what ways can language ideologies be useful or are they something that we should try to avoid?
2. What social implications can be made when a certain person or group is excluded or not represented in a mainstream language ideology?  Can this create issues with identity?
3. Many people believe that individuals won’t be able to “get a job” or “be respected” if they have an “accent” or “dialect”? How would you respond to these beliefs? Give some examples based on this week’s lecture/readings.
