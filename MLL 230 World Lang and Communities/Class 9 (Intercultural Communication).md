# Class 9: Intercultural Communication
## Intercultural Communcation: 
- A field of study that looks at how people from differing cultural backgrounds communicate in similar and different ways among themselves, and how they endeaver to communicate across cultures.
- Cultural covnentions affect discourse, but does not determine them
- Culture is fluid, not fixed
- "Bad English" can lead to a more simplified English
## Ethnocentrism
- The view that one's own group is the center of everything, and other groups are rated in reference to how they stack up in relation to one's group.
- Need to be culturally aware in order to be able to interpret someone's behavior relative to its cultural context
## Interaction is Negotiated through communicative competence, not by "misunderstandings"
## Individualistic vs. Collectivistic
### Individual Cultures
1. Fostering independence and individual achievement
2. Promoting self-expression, individual thinking, personal choice
3. Associated with egalitarian relationships and flexibility in roles (e.g. upward mobility)
4. Associated with private property individual ownership
### Collective Cultures
1. Fostering interdependence and group success
2. Promoting adherence to norms, respect for authority/elders, group consensus
3. Associated with stable, hierarchial roles (dependent on gender, family background, age)
4. Associated  with shared property, group ownership
## High and low context
- ==Low-context==: cultures that rely heavily on words to convey the main message
	- Needs verbal cues; can't read non-verbal cues
- ==High-context==: cultures that rely heavily on the context of the interaction
## Face
- **Face** refers to the respect that an individual has for themself and maintaining that self-esteem in public or in private situation. Any speech act may impose on this self-esteem and is therefore face threatening. Speakers have strategiesfor lessening the threat
	- **Positive face**: self-worth recognized
	- **Negative face**: not to be imposed on
- Different people groups and 'cultures' have their own characteristic repertoire of face saving practices
## Power DIfferentials
- Conversational dominance - through interruption, comparatively lengthy utterances, topic managemet
- Control of other participants' contributions - telling them when to speak, or what to speak about
- Evaluationg other participants' contributions, e.g. approving/praising
- Mode of address
- Use of questions, statements, etc.
- Acknowledgement (or not) of other participants' contributions
# Discussion Questions
1. Why might speaking "Bad English" be considered desirable or advantageous?
2. Describe some examples of interactions you have had with a low-context or high-context culture? Were there instances of confusions or culture shock?
3. In what ways can silence be used as a form  of power? Is it effective?
