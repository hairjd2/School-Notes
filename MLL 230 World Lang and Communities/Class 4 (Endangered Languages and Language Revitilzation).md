# Class 4: Endangered Languages and Language Revitilzation
- "It is accurate to say that languages do not die: they only get transformed."
## Dead Languages:
- A language that is no longer spoken as a mother tongue.
	- Classical languages (Sumerian, Akkadian, Egyptia, Hittite...):
		- Latinis a language as dead as it can be. First it killed the Romans, and now its killing me!
- **dead languages with descendance:** "they only get transformed" is Latin said to be dead because no Romance language bears its name?
- **dead languages without descendance**: “a given language becomes increasingly  restricted in use, and ultimately ceases to be passed on”
- Main reason for death is language shift

## Language Maintenance and Shift
1. speakers simply retain their own L1 and do not learn the L2;
2. speakers learn the L2 as an additional language and retain both their L1 and the L2;
3. speakers learn the L2 as an additional language, but it replaces their L1 as the main (and generally only) language. In some cases this third option happens within the lifetime of one person.
## Language Shift
- This is a process in which one language displaces another in the linguistic repertoire of a community
	- From top to bottom: language ceases to be used in High functions
	- From bottom to top: language is used exclusively for specific High functions
## Scale of language loss -what does this mean
- About 90% of human knowledge encoded in language is:
	- The property of indigenous peoples
	- On the verge of being lost
- Erosion of humanknowledge is proceeding at an unprecendented pace, erasing indigenous identities and societies
- Reduces knowledge about human language and mind
- Death of unique cultures
- 2003 UNESCO paper – language death results in the loss of unique  biological and ecological knowledge
### Scale of language loss (Ethnologue)
- Number of languages: 7097
- 347 (~5%) of languages spoken have >1M = 94% of world pop.
- Remaing languages spoken by 6%
- Median size of a language in the world: ~3000 speakers
## Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger
- Listing of 2,500 endangered and extinct languages
	- Publishedby UNESCO with Norwegian Government support
	- Degree of endangerment | Intergenerational Language Transmission
	-----| ----------------------------------------------------------------
	Safe | Languagespoken by all generations; intergenerational transmission uninterrupted >> not included in atlas
	vulnerable | language spoken by most children, but restricted to certain domains (e.g. home)
	definitely endangered | children no longer learn the language as mother tongue in the home
	severely endangered | language spoken by grandparents and older generations; parent generation may understand it, but do not  speak it to children or among themselves
	critically  endangered | youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently
	extinct | no speakers left >> included in Atlas if presumably extinct since 1950s
### Consequences
- _The consequences of linguistic diversity loss began to be  discussed also in terms of human rights, ethics, and social justice  and of maintaining cultural identity and heritage. (p. 386)_
- Interrelations between the language and the environment (traditional ecological knowledge)
- Biocultural diversity
#### Documentation and description of Innu
- Transcription in Innu and translation in French undertaken by  native Innu speakers from the same community.
- Difficulties encountered with terminology used to talk about  traditional way of life:
	- Traditional activities have been supplanted by modern way of life.
	- Terminology in traditional knowledge is very specific.
- Medical Knowledge:
	- Patush nelu matshi-natukulnaput katshi akutitakanlit tshia, nelu utitshi, eukuan ekue  milualit.
	- “It is only after that we soaked his hand in a liquid poison, you know, and it healed”
	- “After we soaked it in a disinfectant, you know, his hand, then it healed.”*
- Ecological Knowledge
	- Pate takuana ne ashinit takuana, miam ne ulakan-mashkushu ka-ishinakuanuani tshia.
	- “For example there is a rock that looks like ulakan-mashkushu(????) you know.”
	- “For example, it is found on a rock, it looks like a fern .”
- Traditional Knowledge:
	- Nimitshiminan uil takuan nete, netehe an ka nakatakanit netehe, lushkuauat, teshipitakan nete takuan.
	- “There we had food, the place that we left behind,  there, some flour, there was a scaffolding there.”
	- “We had food over there, left behind over there, some flour, there was a cache there.”
## Transmitting Traditional Knowledge
- On-going acculturation: from fur hunting up to the 1950's to modern way of life within a welfare state.
- The linguistic correlates in Fourth World settings are language shift insomecommunities, first language attrition in others.
- Within a single generation, the language associated with travel journeys,  navigational routes, hunting and fishing practices, etc., has been partly  lost, and one expects that within the next generation, it will be nearly or  even completely lost.
- The Innu people have undergone great changes over the last 50 years:
	- they have become increasingly integrated into the global economy
	- formal education and employment are priorities for the younger generations
- Nonetheless, Elders and language activists stress the importance of  maintaining ties to the Innu traditional way of life of their hunter-  gatherer forefathers.
## Preserving Linguistics
- _“To promote the identification of this word [preserving], as referred to  language, with “maintain in context” and “maintain through continued  use and development”, in a way similar to how the word is increasingly  understood in relation to biodiversity.” (p. 387)_
	- Documenting languages
	- Supporting and promoting linguistic diversity
- Defining language diversity
- ![[Pasted image 20220225094659.png]]
## What can we do?
- Language-related policy
- Development of language maintenance and revitalization programs
- Language in education
- Public awareness
- ![[Pasted image 20220225094814.png]]
## Six factors for language revitalization (Crystal 2000)
- An endangered language will progress if its speakers:
	1. Increase their prestige within the dominant community
	2. Increase their wealth
	3. Increase their legitimate power in the eyes of the dominant community
	4. Have a strong presence in the education system
	5. Can write down the language
	6. Can make use of electronic technology
# Mayan Language Revitilization in Guatemala
- ![[Pasted image 20220225095434.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20220225095442.png]]
## Mayan Movement
- Distinctions between Mayas and Non-Mayas (p. 156)
- Characteristics of Movement?:
	- Led by urban intellectuals (some not natively fluent in language)
	- Carve out new apolitical space (p. 158)
	- Create pride "by raising the Mayas' consciousness of their roots and promoting the value of the languages as a link with the glorious past and a symbol of authenticity." (p. 158)
- Guatemalan political history (p. 157)
	- Spanish Conquest 1521
	- Independence 1821
	- 1954 CIA led coup against Jacobo Arbenz  Civil War / Genocide 1954-1996
		- Worst violence 1982-1987
		- 250,000 killed
		- 450 Maya villages eliminated
		- 1 million people displaced
		- (1992 Rigoberta Menchu wins Nobel Peace Prize)
## Today
- Population: 12 million
- Ladino = mix of indiginous and European (officially = 59% population)
- Maya = 35% (some studies have Maya = 60+%)
- Political stability?
## Domestic language use
- Changed language attitudes = reverse the trend of language shift
	- Acquisition not automatic ("generic" view of language)
	- Give parents guidelines for transmitting their language
- Attitudes that hinder language acquisition (p. 160)
	- Imperfect output/mixing is pathological
	- Stable bilingualism is impossible
	- Mayan language will hinder school performance
	- Low prestige in part because of Spanish loanwords
## Literacy in Mayan Languages
- Promoting literacy is key to advancing Mayan nationalism
	- Increased appreciation of culture
	- Relation between writingand power
- Overcoming negative schooling experience
	- Spanish literacy in unfriendly environment
	- Mayan literacy in Maya oriented classes, taught by Mayas
- Overcomes stereotypes about deficiencies in Mayan language
- Logistical/Financial problems
1. Literacy training and Socialization
2. Literacy training and Acculturation
3. Literacy training and Vocational Training
4. Literacy training as a Stimulus to Intellectual Growth
## Peace Accords (1996)
- Accords on the Identity and Rights of the Indigenous Peoples (1995)
	- Among first accords signed
	- Identity key points
		- Mayan Languages
		- Descent from ancient Mayans
		- World view
		- Culture
		- Self-identification
- Language Rights
	- Constitutional recognition
	- Bilingual education
	- Use of Mayan in government services
	- Informing Indigenous of rights
	- Training bilingual judges and interpreters
	- Fostering appreciation of indigenous languages
	- Officialization of indigenous languages
- Concilitatory toward non-indigenous
	- "All languages should be respected"
# Discussion Questions
1. In what ways are endangered languages and endangered species (biodiversity) similar? In which ways are they different?
2. What are some advantages of studying a "dead" or "formerly dead" languages like Latin or Hebrew?
3. Do some research on a language revitilization program. How do they 'reinvigorate' the language?
