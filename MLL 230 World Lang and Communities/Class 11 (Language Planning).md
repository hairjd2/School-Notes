		- Unification
		- Modernisation
		- Democratisation
		- Improved commuication
	- Decision making is motivated by:
		- Linguistic pluralism
		- Linguistic assimilation
		- Vernacularization
		- Internationalization
### Pluralism
- Linguisitic pluralism promotes the "coexistence of different language groups and their right to maintain and cultivate their languages on an equitable basis".
	- More democratic
	- Protection of minority languages
	- Cannot prevent diglossia/assimilation
### Assimilation
- One language for all
- Purism
- Nation-state ideology
- "Minorized" languages
- Language shift and endangerment
## Internationalization
- The ideology which consists in adopting ==a no indigenous language of wider communcation either as an official language or a language of instruction==
	- Modernization
	- World trade ad technology
	- Language is not spoken (like French in Haiti)
### Vernacularization
- ==Indigenous or national languages are restored or modernized and officially recognized== in lieu of or alogside a international language of wider communication.
	- Democratic
	- Standardization
## Actors
- Authorities must recogise ethical and moral as well as linguistic obligations when making recommendations
- Usually associated with government planning, but is also used by a variety of NGOs
- Communities and individuals can also be actors of language planning
## Planning
### Status planninng
- Concerned with whether the social status of a language should be lowered or raised
- The allocationor reallocation of a language or variety to functional domains within a society, thus affecting the status or standing of a language
### Corpus Planning
- Refers to all actions aiming at modifying "==the nature of the language itself=="
- Refers to ==the prescriptive intervention in the forms of a language==, whereby planning decisions are made to engineer ==changes in the structure of the language==.
- Three areas:
	1. Writing ("graphization")
	2. Standardization/Normalization ("grammatication" = prescriptive rules)
	3. Modernization ("lexication" = new words)
## Language Cultivation
- Implementation
	- Spread of plans to the population (laws, education)
	- Evaluation of results
- Elaboration
	- Keeping the language up-to-date 
	- Adjusting the language to new domains of use
# Discussion Questions
1. In what ways does the US perpetuate the myth of English as a national unifying language? What are some other myths regarding languages being spoken in the US?
2. What language do you plan to speak to your children/young people in your life? What are some barriers to that plan?
3. Why might countries decide to make the colonizer langauge the official language instead of an indigenous language?
