# Class 3 (Bilingual and Multilingual Community)
## Communities
### Speech community
- Each community unique
- Geography
- Perceived Solidarity and interaction based on reference to a particular language (community of practice)
- Constantly shifting boundaries
- Linguistic choices made by members play an important role in constructing meaning and identity
### Bilingual Communities
- The use of two or more languages
- Different levels of competence (active vs. passive)
- "each bilingual community is unique"
### Countries as speech communities
- "Imagined Community"
- 6700 languages vs 200 nation-states
	- Unequal distribution
	- Less than 4% have official status
	- Most unwritten, spoken by small groups
- "Usually the more powerful groups in any society are able to force their language upon the less powerful"
### Composition of Multilingual States
- Varies greatly -- depending on country's history
- Border areas
- Differences between perceived and actual competencies
- Indigenous vs. migrant minority languages
### Community Multilingualism
- Individual multilingualism:
- Societal multilingualism:
	- The state is bilingual so that the citizens can remain monlingual
- What matters:
	- Demolinguistic situtation of the linguistic groups
	- Sociolinguistic status of the respective languages
## Diglossia
- Diglossia of two unrelated languages that are assigned High and Low status, and particular social and economic niches.
	- Mandarin and Cantonese in China
	- English and French in Quebec in the 1950s
	- Colonial situation: colonial language vs. local language
	- Institutional language use: Langue d'oil vs. Langue d'oc in 16th century France
- The term diglossia applies to any situation where two languages (or varieties) are not equally used in a society. (heteroglossia)
## Is English a 'Global Language'?
- Impact of European expansion
- Increasing bilingualism in metropolitan languages (mostly English)
	- More speakers of English as second language than native speakers
	- Global Diglossia
		- Reflects global power relations
- Extinction of smaller languages
	- 50% of known languages have disappeared in last 500 years
	- 50% of remaining languages will disappear in next 100 years
- At the same time, massive migration has led to greater linguistic diversity with countries
	- Little enthusiasm for immigrant languages
	- Status differences
- Second language acquisition seen as important, but immigrant bilingualism equated with poverty, low status
## Public Policy Implications
- Language policy and language planning
	- Which languages to use
	- How to raise status?
	- Case of South Africa -- despite efforts, English becoming lingua franca
- De jure vs. de facto multilingualism
	- European cases
	- Former colonies
	- Majority vs. minority rights
- "Coexistence of more than one language is  not in itself a cause of inter-group conflict…conflicts involving language are not really about language but about fundamental  inequalities between groups who happen to  speak different languages” (p. 403).

# Discussion Questions
1. How would you describe multilingualism where you live? What constitutes a multilingual neighborhood?

3. Do you believe the US will have/already has a multilingual policy like Belgium? Why or why not?
