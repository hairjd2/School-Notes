# Language Diversity
## What is language diversity
- Coexistence of many languages in the area
- This could mean an official language exists or a majority language exists
## Papua New Guinea
- Highest language diversity
- Has 839 different languages
- Located in Oceania in the southwestern Pacific Ocean
- 0.4% of the geographical region
- spoken 13% of the world languages
## How many are spoken in the world today
- There are almost 7000 languages in the world and about 200 independent countries
- There are languages with millions of speakers and languages at risk
- Less people speak more number of languages and more people speak less number of languages
- 94% languages have been spoken by the 6% of the people. 6% of languages spoken by 94% of the people.
	- This could be due to wealth and class status of countries
## Multilingualism
- More common for people to be multilingual
- It is a normal and unremarkable necessity for the majority of the world's population
- Common in countries to have multiple languages on the same sign for accessibility
- Done to include all members of a community
- Can indicate that it is a tourist location or indicate the community that lives there.
- There is an increasing linguistic and cultural diversity in western societies
	- This could be due to technology
	- Also caused by the spread of english
	- For example there are more English speakers in China than Chinese speakers in America
## Why do we have so many languages
### 1. Evolution
#### - Monogenesis
- All languages evolved from a single ancestral languages as ancient humans migrated out of Africa
- From genticist Sarah Tishkoff: "Pretty much every study that's ever been done involving looking at genetic variation in Africans compared to non-Afircans always shows more diversity in Africans (...) Modern humans have been in Africa longer than any other region of the world"
#### - Polygenesis
- Multiple ancestral languages developed independently, as did agriculture and the domestication of animals
- Johnathan Loh and David Harmon: "There's huge linguistic diversity in Africa, but its not concentrated in Africa in the same way as genetic diversity (...) Languages evolve so much faster. Cultural evolution is so much faster than biological evolution"
### 2. Population movement
#### Effects of migration
1. Isolation from original language
2. Diversification
	- Local Social Conditions
	- Contact with local languages
##### ==Language Family==: a group of languages with a common ancestor
- ==Proto-Indo-European (PIE)==
	- The hypothetical common ancestor of the Indo-European languages, spoken by the PIEs
	- Proto means before, so before english, latin, spanish, and french
	- ![[Pasted image 20220203021613.png]]
	- Occured in 6000 BP

#### Are all languages related
- Presence of diverse structural features in languages in an area irrespective of the families of languages they belong. These areas are called linguistic area
- A linguistic area is "a geographical region containing a group of three or more languages that share some structural features as a result of contact rather than as a result of accident or inheritance from a common ancestor"
### 3. Warfare
- War can kill out a language
- The conquerors may wipe out the language because the conquerors will irradicate the language
- Especially by making their language mandatory
#### Borders
- Borders can define where certain languages are divided, but does not always mean that a language will only be spoken there
- Even with political lines, people will speak another language
### 4. Geography
- Languages are not spread randomly across the planet
- Physical inaccessibility (like mountains in the way) can isolate communities and cause different languages
- Also included whistling to be heard for certain terrain
- Far more languages are found in tropical regions than in the temperate zones
- Independent of size and population of country
### 5. Rain
- Three basic assumptions
	1. Populations will move to fill availables spaces where no one else lives
	2. Rainfall will limit the number of people that can live in a place; the model assumed that people would live in higher densities in areas where it rained more
	3. Assumed that human populations have a max size. In the model, when a population grew larger than max threshold - set randomly based on a golbal distribution of hunter-gatherer population sizes - it divided into two populations, each speaking a distinct language.
- The more rain that an area has, the more diversity of language that area has
- This was proved mainly true through a study in Australia
### 6. Acoustic Adaptation
- Languages from warm areas with dense tree cover tend to have less consonants and had more vowel sounds.
- Also tended to have clicking sounds that could be heard better in those areas
### 7. Other examples
- Culture
- Identity
- Language defines the speaker; it gives them an identity and the assurance of belonging inside a cultural group. This characteristic also ensures the protection and survival of the language
## Language Endangerment
- A negative term that represents and unfair suitation in which the natural existence of being is under threat
- This represents a set of unsafe phenmenon of language vitality with different degree endangerment where the specific language or a group of languages are potentially in danger
- ==Language Vitality==: used to indicate the ability of a language to endure as an individual language in a multilingual environment.
- Some examples:
	- Celtic language Breton spoken in Brittany, France
	- Welsh language in Wales, UK
- Nine factors of language vitality:
	1. Absolute number of speakers
	2. Intergenerational language transmission
	3. Community member's attitudes towards their own language
	4. Shifts in domains of language use
	5. Governmental and institutional language attitudes and policies, including official status and use
	6. Type and quality of documentation
	7. Response to new domains and media
	8. Availability of materials for language education and literacy
	9. Proportion of speakers within the total population
- Status | Grade | Description
   ------------ | ------------ | ------
   Safe | 5 | The language is used by all ages from children up
   Unsafe | 4 | The language is used by some children in all domains; it is used by all children in limited domains
   Definitely endangered | 3 | The language is used mostly by the parental generation and up
   Severely endangered | 2 | The language is used mostly by the grandparental generation and up
   Critically endangered | 1 | The language is used mostly by very few speakers, of great-grandparental generation.
   Extinct | 0 | There exists no speaker.
- Counteracted through multilingual education
### Should we mourn language death?
- This is similar to an extinction of a species
## Discussion Board Questions
1. How does language intersect with culture and identify? Can you give examples?
2. Have you been in an environment of multilingualism? What were the languages represented and what did the multitude of languages reveal about the environment?
3. How do you propose we celebrate language diversity and combat language extinction?
