# Class 10: Bilingual Education
## Bilingual Education
- Not uncommon in other countries. 
- Includes having multiple languages of instruction
- Would split up subjects between the two languages
###  Programs
- **Immersion Programs**: a "sink or swim" approach, students are placed in regular english-speaking classrooms
- **Structured Immersion Programs**: students are taught by teachers fluent in the student's native language, but instruction is in English and teacher responses are also primarily in English
- **ESL**: students stay in the regular classroom for most of the day but are "pulled out" at various times for English instruction
- **Transitional Bilingual Education**: efforts are made to "phase out" the student's native language while developing a facility in English as quickly as possible
- **Dual Language Immersion**: 50% in nation's language and native language
	- can be one-way or two-way

### Ideologies
- **Monoglossic** ideologies of bilingualism and bilingual education treat each of the child's languages as separate and whole, and view the two languages asbounded autonmous systems
- A **heterogloassic** ideology of bilingualism considers multiple language practices in interrelationship, and leads to other constructions of bilingual education.
### Criticisms
- "English is the language of economic opportunity" and a means to access the "American Dream"
- Segregated classrooms
- Imutable relationship between language and identity
- Bilingual educatuion as illegal
