# Class 8: Grammer in Contact
## Pidgins and Creoles
- New languages
	- Time frame: 500-150 years ago
	- Older in the Atlantic, younger in the Pacific
- Context of birth
	- European expansion and colonization
		- Commercial contacts (Pidgins)
		- Plantation economies (Creoles)
### Development of a Pidgin
- prolonged, regular contact between the different language communites
- A need to communicate between them
- An absence of (or absence of broad base of speakers) in a widespread, accessible interlanguage
- Pidgin
	- Language varieties developed by speakers in contact who share no common language
	- Has limited functions of use
	- Adjunct language (no one speaks only a pidgin)
	- Linguistically simplified
	- Few lexical items,must chosen from a dominant language
	- Other language contributes to the syntax and some of the morphology.
	- Korean Bamboo English
	- Can be used in a negative sense like Tay Boi
		- Wouldn't use native language of servants but

- Usually learned alongside of a language
### Creole
- Is the first language of a speech community
- Used for a wide range of functions like any natural language
- Rule of thumb: Creolists generally accept that creole formation is a process of language acquisition. Children play a role in regularizing the developing grammar
- Creoles usually are the language
- Creoles are more complex than pidgins and far richer

# Discussion Questions
1. In what ways are pidgins/creoles beneficial to society? In what ways are they detrimental to society?
2. Read an article from https://www.bbc.com/pidgin. What patterns do you notice in Pidgin English versus Standard English? What are the similarities and differences?
3. Can two contact languages ever be societally equal? Why or why not?
4. A myth about creoles is that they are not “real” languages, or that they are a “broken” form of the superstrate language. What would you say to someone making these comments? How would you defend creoles as legitimate languages? Where do you think these views of creoles come from?
