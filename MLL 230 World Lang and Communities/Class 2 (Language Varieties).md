# Languages, Dialects, and Varieties
## Language Varieties
- Refers to the various forms of language triggered by social factors.
- Language may vary from region to region, social class to class, individual to individual, and from situation to situation. 
### Why are varieties called dialects instead of different language
- Solely because they are not written languages
- Because the speakers of the given language do not have a state of their own
- Because they are not used in press or literature, or very little
- Or because they lack prestige
## Language and Dialect
- Both terms are often used interchangeably
- Principle of mutual intelligbility differentiates between them.
- 'Mutual Intelligibility': If two varieties of speech are mutual intelligible -> dialect
- If they are not mutual intelligible -> language
- England is very dialect dense with Scottish and Irish dialects
- Examples of Factors of differences
	- Religious Borders
	- Cultural Borders
	- National Borders
		- Dialect Continuum -> adjacent regions can understand each other speech, regions further may not understand each other
		- amstrd | dusseldorf | cologne | trier | berdorf
			----- | ------------- | -------- | ---- | --------
			ik | ich | ich | ich | ich
			maken | maken | machen | machen | machen
			dorp | dorp | dorp | dorf | dorf
			dat | dat | dat | dat | das
	- Language (prestige) and dialect (stigma)
	- The stigmatization of the term dialect
	- "I don't speak dialect"
	- All speakers speaker some dialect
	- ==Standard "Language"==: a variety of language may be officially _elevated_ as the official/national language.
### Nature of Standard
- It is so called _standard_ literally, but just as what the definition suggests, it is a variety of language, so it is also termed as "standard variety".
- Linguistically, the standard has nothing special
- Its a variety of language **has the luck to rise to become the standard.**
#### Standard Variety
- The standard variety can be said to be a superposed, socially prestigious variety of language
- Because it functions as the public means of communication, it is subject to extensive normalization especially in grammar, pronounciation, and spelling.
- Command of the standard variety is the goal of formal language instruction
### Regional Dialects
- A variety of a language used recognizably in a specific region is called a dialect
- The study of dialects is called dialectology.
- Accent: ==perceived== pronounciation and vocab; every speaker has an accent
## Reasons for Dialect Boundaries
- Settlement history
- Presence of natural barriers
- Migration Patterns
- Ideologies
- = isolation and contact
## Isoglosses
- Dialect features (= shibboleth) can be divided by lines called isoglosses
- Dialect features usually cluster together in bundles
	- We draw dialect boundaries where these bundles occur
	- Usually with phonological features, there is little overlap in isoglosses, because many of these patterns are systematic (e.g., changes affect several vowels together)
	- With lexical and syntactic features, there may be more overlap, since these don't generally reflect a system
## Social Dialects (Sociolects)
- The term sociolect is used todescribe differences in speech associated with various social groups or classes.
- Whereas regional dialects are geographically based, social dialects originate among social groups are related to a variety of factors:
	- Gender, age, ethnic group, religion, and class.
- Examples
	- Caste in India often determines which variety of a language a speaker use.
	- Christian, Muslim and Jewish in Baghdad speak different varieties of Arabic.
	- Ethnic groups in America: Speakers of Jewish and Italian ethnicity differentiable from other varieties.
# Language and Dialect in China
## The Problem
- There is a dichotomy between national language and regional dialects.
- **Dialects** refer to languages that are:
	- Minority
	- Non-official
	- Non-standard
	- Non-written
## The Languages in China
- The language of the Han people, the major ethnic group of China
- Appr. 95% of the Chinese pop.
- Non-Chinese languages in China: The languages of Tibetan, Mongolian, Uygur, Miao, Korean and other 53 minorities
- Majority Chinese-speaking pop. is in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, Substantial numbers are also found throughout the Southeast Asia, especially in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.
- Important Chinese-speaking communities are also found in many other parts of the world, especially in Europe, North and South America, and the Hawaiian Islands.
### The "Chinese Languages"
- Sino-Tibetanlanguages = language family
	- Spoken by over 1 billion people
	- Mandarin 850 million speakers
	- Wu 90 million (Shanghai)
	- Min 70 million (Taiwan)
	- Yue (Cantonese) 70 million (Hong Kong)
### Its Dialects
- Spoken Chinese comprises many regional dialects. Each dialect group consists of a large number of sub-dialects.
- The boundaries between one so-called dialect and the next are not always easy to define.
- Most Chinese speak one of the Mandarin dialects, which are largely mutually intelligible.
## A problem of terminology
- 方言 (Fāngyán) is often translated as "dialect"
- What is the difference
	- Dialect = linguistic proximity (mutual intelligibility)
	- 方言 = "from the same region, share a common standard language and writing system, and are descendants of a common parent language in history"
## Language Policy
- 普通话 (Pǔtōnghuà) = standard Mandarin (Beijing dialect)
	- Government business
	- Medium of instruction
	- Media
- Many people use another language in their region, but are expected to use 普通话 as a national language of communication
## Taiwan 
- 闽南 (Mǐnnán) or Fujiunese and Hakka as languages of the nation
## Hong Kong
- The status of Cantonese
- Will 普通话 replace Cantonese as the main language of Hong Kongers
## Writing system
- Logographic: each symbol refers to a specific word
	- Does English have logographic symbols
	- For examples:
		- &
		- %
		- $
		- 3

## Discussion Board Questions:
1. What are some of the features of the dialect/languages you speak/sign?
2. In what ways is Standard English dominant in American culture? In what ways is it not?
3. How do you predict the Chinese language will change as a result of China's Language Policy?
