# Chapter 13 Magnetically Coupled Circuits
## 1. Review of Self Inductance
- Magnetic flux $\phi \propto i$
- Magnetic flux linkage: $\lambda=N\phi$
- N --- number of turns of coil
- Faraday's law: $L=N\frac{d\phi}{di}$
- $p$ --- permeance of space occupied by the magnetic field
## 2. Mutual Inductance
