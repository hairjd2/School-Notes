# Information
## Data vs. Information
- Data: 
	- Raw facts or observations about physical phenomena (event), entities (people, place, things), transactions, etc.
	- Objective measurement of the attributes of entities
	- Could be numeric, alphanumeric (text), figures, sounds, images, etc.
- Information: Organized data that have meaning for the recipient

# Security
- The quality or state of being secure - to be free from danger
- Types:
	- Physical
	- Personnel
	- Operations
	- Communications
	- Network
	- Information
## Information Security
- “The protection of information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction in order to provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability”. (NIST, 2013)‏
- What to secure
	- Important characteristics of information
	- Different states of data
	- Focus is on computing
- How secure
	- Processes, framework
- Why it is so important
	- Use of IS everywhere
	- The big attacks will come through IS (computing)
- Need to safeguard all relevant components
- Also important to accept that it is not possible to obtain absolute security
## Risk
- Exposure to the change of injury or loss
- The possibility that something unpleasant will happen
## Balancing InSec and Access
- Impossible to obtain perfect security - it is a process, not an absolute
- Security should be considered balance between protection and availability
- To achieve balance, level of security must allow reasonable access, yet protect against threats

- Approach to InSec
	- Recognize that it is impossible to prevent all cyber attacks or to create control to reduce or eliminate all cyber threats
	- Follow a risk - based approach

- Expanded CIA Triangle; Critical Characteristics of Information
	- The value of information comes from the characteristics it possesses:
		- ==Availability== (brings up the assurance)
		- Accuracy
		- Authenticity
		- ==Confidentiality==
		- ==Integrity==
		- Accountability
			- Utility
			- Possession
