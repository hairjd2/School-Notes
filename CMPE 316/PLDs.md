# ROM
## CMOS Process
- Transistors are built through a series of manufacturing steps
- Etching - material is removed
- Deposition - material is added
- The areas to be processed for etching or deposition are defined by a mask
## Memory as Logic
- Mask programming was used to create memories known as ROM
# PROM
- Adds fuse links to ROM
# PLA
- Programmable OR and AND array
# PAL
- Implements sum of products
- Built from two Programmable arrays:
	- Programmable AND gates (3-input ANDs)
	- Programmable or gates (1 to 8 input ORs)
	- For programmable and arrays not all inputs have to be fabbed	
- Number decided by manufacturer
- Downside is the limited number of terms that can be OR'ed compared to PLA
- Fixed OR array and programmable AND array
# Flash Memory
- Has read/write capabilities through blocks
- NOR memory is for storing code and execution
- NAND is for storing data
