# Discrete-Time Convolution
- Recall: ![[Pasted image 20240901133301.png]]
	- This shows the "stemming" of each value of the DT signal
	- It defines the superposition of the signal
- ![[Pasted image 20240901133325.png]]
- that h[n] = H{\delta[n]} is called the system impulse response
- You can find any output signal by any delay k just by knowing the system impulse response
- Convolution denoted by \*, like $y[n]=x[n]*h[n]$
