# Schaum's Outline
- ![[Pasted image 20241128095736.png]]
	- Define a random variable within some sample space
	- Map to real values ($f:S\rightarrow T$)
	- ![[Pasted image 20241128095942.png]]
	- For example, when flipping a coin, you can map getting a heads to 1 and tails to a 0

# Random Variables

	- C(12, 3): "12 choose 3"

# Finite Random Variable
- ![[Pasted image 20241128101710.png]]
- Will usually allow the continuous variables between the discrete values be 0 to prevent needing to integrate
- PDF (woohoo)

### Expectation of Random Variable
- ![[Pasted image 20241128105007.png]]
	- Can think of it being a weighted average of the random variable
## Variance and Standard Deviation

## Cumulative Distribution Function
- ![[Pasted image 20241128112623.png]]
- Unlike PDF, you will see a monotonic function
- ![[Pasted image 20241128112740.png]]
- Has to approach the value of 1
