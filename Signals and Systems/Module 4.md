# Definition of the CT Fourier Transform
- ![[Pasted image 20240914173425.png]]
- CT Fourier Transform (CTFT) decomposition for aperiodic signals x(t):
	- $x(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}X(\Omega)e^{j\Omega t}d\Omega$
- Where the CTFT function is found via:
	- $X(\Omega)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x(t)e^{-j\Omega t}dt$

- Double arrows means that its a Fourier Transform pair
- Omega is the radian frequency

	1. Having a larger a value means it will converge much quicker
	2. Much more spread out
- When a time domain signal changes more quickly in time, you need high frequency content to support that.
## Examples of CTFT Pairs
- Example 1: Rectangular Pulse
	- ![[Pasted image 20240916211005.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20240916211010.png]]
	- Pretty simple, lets us put it into terms of a
	- ![[Pasted image 20240916211124.png]]
	- Use Euler's identity: ![[Pasted image 20240916211138.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20240916211315.png]]
	- Results in a sinc function: ![[Pasted image 20240916211403.png]]
	- Notice that the 0 crossings occur at pi/a
	- The signal is diminishing 1/freq
	- As a gets large, the curve will get narrower and higher
- Example 2: CTFT of Unit Impulse: ![[Pasted image 20240916211719.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20240916212204.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20240916212211.png]]
	- Need relatively high frequencies to support it
## Convergence of the CTFT
- Sufficient conditions for the existence of the CTFT of x(t) are given by:
	- x(t) is absolutely integrable:
		- ![[Pasted image 20240916212308.png]]
		- Similarity to stability of LTI
	- x(t) has a finite number of maxima and minima with any finite interval
	- x(t) has a finite number of discontinuities within any finite interval, and each of these discontinuities is finite
## Inverse CTFT Examples
- Example 1: ![[Pasted image 20240917230934.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20240917231105.png]]
	- When you have a functional form in time with a fourier transform, you will have a functional form in frequency with a transform to a functional form in time, creating a duality
	- ![[Pasted image 20240917231222.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20240917231243.png]]
	- ^ Means if you have a box in time function and a sinc in frequency function, then having sinc function in time will yield a box in frequency domain
- Example 2: ![[Pasted image 20240917231356.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20240917231405.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20240917231428.png]]
	- If you have a single sinusoidal component at frequency omega naught, then its FT is an impulse at that frequency
	- ![[Pasted image 20240917231534.png]]
	- Frequency content is discrete in this example, similar to the FS we looked at
### CTFT Periodic Signals 
- ![[Pasted image 20240917231730.png]]
	- Series of impulses at the harmonic frequencies
	- The weights at those frequencies are really
	- Also consistent with discrete frequencies

## CTFT Properties
- Linearity: $a_1x_1(t)+a_2x_2(t)\leftrightarrow a_1X_(\Omega)a_2X_2(\Omega)$
- If x(t) is real-valued, then $X(-\Omega)=X^*(\Omega)$
	- ![[Pasted image 20240917232552.png]]
	- Magnitude of fourier transform function will be even
	- ![[Pasted image 20240917232629.png]]
- Time Shift: $x(t-t_0)\leftrightarrow X(\Omega)e^{-j\Omega t_0}$
	- Does not affect magnitude, but phase
- Time Scaling: $x(\alpha t)\leftrightarrow \frac{1}{|\alpha|}X(\frac{\Omega}{\alpha})$
- Time reversal: $x(-t)\leftrightarrow X(-\Omega)$
- Example: ![[Pasted image 20240917232918.png]]
	- Start with the components of the signal
	- ![[Pasted image 20240917233114.png]]
	- Find a FT Pair we already know
	- ![[Pasted image 20240917233154.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20240917233305.png]]
	- Then can write q(t) in relation of y(t) as an expansion
	- ![[Pasted image 20240917233515.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20240917233553.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20240917233608.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20240917233704.png]]
- Frequency Shift: $x(t)e^{j\Omega_0t}\leftrightarrow X(\Omega-\Omega_0)$ <- Extremely important, used by communication systems like amplitude modulation
	- ![[Pasted image 20240917233954.png]]
	- Allows for the same channel to be used by different users to be able to shift the frequency around
- Differentiation: $\frac{dx(t)}{dt}\leftrightarrow j\Omega X(\Omega)$
- Integration: $\int_{\infty}^{t}\leftrightarrow\frac{1}{j\Omega}X(\Omega)+\pi X(0) \delta(\Omega)$
- Time-domain convolution: $y(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x(\tau)h(t-\tau)d\tau\leftrightarrow Y(\Omega)=X(\Omega)H(\Omega)$
	- The FT of the input signal and system response are just multiplied together instead of needing to do the integral
	- Time domain versus frequency domain interpretation
- Multiplication: $x(t)w(t)\leftrightarrow\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}X(\lambda)W(\Omega-\lambda)d\lambda$
	- Also known as windowing
- Duality: $X(t)\leftrightarrow2\pi x(-\Omega)$
- Parseval's Relation: $E=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|x(t)|^2dt=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|X(\Omega)|^2d\Omega$
	- This allows you to find the energy of the signal by finding the integral of the FT magnitude squared.
	- Also pretty handy to know
# Frequency Domain Analysis of LTI Systems
- Impulse Response of Ideal Low Pass Filter
	- ![[Pasted image 20240918200548.png]]
	- Simply the inverse fourier transform of the above response signal
	- ![[Pasted image 20240918200707.png]]
	- Can solve by finding when at the origin or when t is 0
	- Value at this origin: ![[Pasted image 20240918200925.png]]
	- (Area under the H(Omega))
- Frequency Domain Analysis of LTI Systems
	- ![[Pasted image 20240918201003.png]]
	- Convolution in time is multiplication in frequency
- LTI analysis Example: ![[Pasted image 20240918202735.png]]
	- Know that its an ideal low pass filter
	- ![[Pasted image 20240918202750.png]]
	- Know X(Omega): ![[Pasted image 20240918202844.png]]
	- Multiply them to get the same as convolution by the system response signal
	- ![[Pasted image 20240918202951.png]]
	- Anything outside of that Omegac will be rejected
	- The product will then look exactly like the impulse response
	- ![[Pasted image 20240918203031.png]]
- Different inputs
	- ![[Pasted image 20240918203104.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20240918203149.png]]
		- The output signal is the same linear combination as the input signal modified by what frequency response is doing
	- ![[Pasted image 20240918203212.png]]
		- Need to now look at the fourier transform
		- It is simply the product of the input and the frequency response
	- Frequency response is just a modification to the input into the output of the system
