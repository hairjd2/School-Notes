# Planned Obsolescence
## From: https://durabilitymatters.com/planned-obsolescence/
- The planned failure of products by companies to ensure that consumers continue to buy more and more products
- Businesses don't make money selling products if products lifetime lasts forever
- ### Four types of Planned Obsolescence
#### Contrived Durability
- Most common
- Its when parts break down intentionally
- Products are made with parts companies know will fail so that people keep buying the product
- Seems like newer products last less as long as older products, which is why older stuff can still work
#### Software Updates
- When updated software requires the consumer to buy new product in order to get it to work
- Also can be when phones are not updated anymore with the latest update
- For example iPhone 6s will not be able to update with the newest iOS update
#### Perceived Obsolescence
- Falls under clever marketing
- Makes the consumer believe their device or product is obsolete to make them want to buy another one
- Why devices like smart phones have new models every year
- Uses the FOMO
#### Prevention of Repair
- Companies make it purposefully difficult and against the warranty to repair devices
- Even with simple parts like batteries
- Relates alot with lower battery performance and an inability to replace it, leading to a battery not able to handle the fully functional phone
### Examples of Planned Obsolescence
#### 1. Slowed Down iPhones
- Apple discretely updated phones to slow down processing in order to keep up with lower battery performance
- Lawsuit was won against apple and they slashed prices of replacement batteries so that they could speed up software
#### 2. Protected Ink Cartridges
- Replacement ink cartridges tend to be more expensive than the printer
- Purposefully take a loss on the printer sales in order to make more money on ink cartridges
- Buying replacement ink cartridges because they can't be refilled is a waste of money and resources
#### 3. Marginally Modified Textbooks
- Every new issue of a textbook is purposefully changed slightly so that numbers are off, meaning students are forced to buy new copies instead of purchasing second-hand copies
- Need specific page numbers when professor assigns hw
#### 4. Fast Fashion, Low-Quality Clothes
- Fast fashion clothes are purposefully made with low quality in order to be able to quickly flood the market with the next trend, in order to save costs
-  Can be better to buy fashion forward clothes that are the trend setters, instead of fast fashion brands that tend to be trend followers
#### 5. Yearly Updates on Cars
- Many planned obsolescence with car selling
- Parts are purposefully switched out yearly even if the parts work fine
- Cars are made to seem like fashion accessories, so marketing makes it look better to have a brand new car
- Can be better to use used cars, in order to reduce the use of resources
#### 6. Unrepairable Consumer Electronics
- Repair is purposefully made difficult so that consumers must go to the distributor to repair it
- The issue is that repairs tend to be just slightly cheaper than just buying a new product, making it more appealing to buy something new
#### 7. Short Lasting Light Bulbs
