# Critical Thinking
1. What am I being asked to believe or accept?
2. What evidence is available to support the claim?
3. What alternative ways are there to interpret the evidence?
4. Rate the evidence/alternatives on 0-10 scale based on validity/strength
5. What assumptions or biases came up when doing the above steps?
6. What additional evidence would help us evaluate the alternatives?
7. What conclusions are most reasonable or likely?
